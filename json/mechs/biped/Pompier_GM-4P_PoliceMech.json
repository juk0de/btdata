        "overview": "General Motor\u2019s popular Pompier FireMech was subject to tests with Fusion engines in the late 3070s, which resulted in a SecurityMech prototype. Spiraling costs and critical design flaws led to a shutdown of the project, but what should have merely been a routine R&D procedure became a PR disaster when the prototype was stolen in 3080 and later turned up in the possession of the notorious kidnapper Jill Jade. GM reacted quickly by refitting production Pompiers to SecurityMech standards and disseminating them to law enforcement agencies in what would later become the Davion Fringe Prefectures.",
        "capabilities": "By utilizing the existing FireMech frame, a major flaw of the original SecurityMech prototype, its woeful lack of armor, could be addressed. The Pompier\u2019s shell obviously does not hold up to assault by military equipment, but it served well to stop the prototype\u2019s anti-infantry weaponry\u2014and an ejection seat was added in the case it did not. Retaining a re-rated production variant of the prototype\u2019s in-house fusion reactor allowed for the replacement of the original\u2019s fluid gun with an anti-\u2019Mech pulse laser, which would ensure reasonable accuracy even when aimed by ill-trained civilian pilots.",
        "deployment": "The hunt for Jill Jade drew from agencies on nearly a dozen worlds, as well as a Security Directorate team led by Knight Errant Ian Blackmore. This multi-national effort was supported by the donation of two lances of Pompier PoliceMechs and the sale at lowered cost of many more to every participating agency. Three years of effort saw the task force perpetually one step behind Jade, though the increased pressure of the investigation limited her to fewer than ten successful kidnappings during that period. In June 3087, the task force received information that placed Jade on Yangtze and Knight Blackmore led a large team to apprehend her. However, in reality Jade was on the team\u2019s base world of Alrescha for her next victim. During delivery of the ransom, junior patrolman Chris Koros stumbled upon the drop. Piloting one of the new Pompiers, Koros engaged Jade in a battle that spanned seventeen city blocks, in which the officer\u2019s superior firepower was offset by his opponent\u2019s willingness to inflict civilian casualties. After nearly sacrificing himself to protect a group of tourists, Koros managed to incapacitate Jill Jade with a pulse laser shot to the side of the cockpit. Severely\u2014though not fatally\u2014injured, Jade was finally apprehended and patrolman Koros was hailed as a hero.",
