The standout feature of this variant is the quartet of Rotary AC/2s, two mounted in each side torso, known for their rapid-fire capability and enhanced accuracy due to the \"stable weapon\" quirk. Complementing this formidable autocannon array are two MRM 10 missile launchers, one in each side torso, adding versatile missile firepower to its arsenal. The Mauler's defense is fortified with Ferro-Fibrous armor, granting substantial protection. Additionally, 12 Double Heat Sinks efficiently manage the heat generated by its weapons, allowing the MAL-2D to maintain a high operational tempo in battle.</p>",

This led to its limited production run and eventual discontinuation. However, the Federated Commonwealth showed interest in the design, acquiring several units from battlefield salvage during the 3040s. These units were predominantly deployed in Lyran units along the Periphery border.</p>",
            "15": "<p>In the late 3040s, LAW revisited the Daboku design, leading to the emergence of the Mauler. This updated version included enhanced range lasers, new heat sink technology, and a lighter engine. Despite initially inheriting the Daboku\u2019s safety flaw, the Mauler became a prominent feature in the DCMS arsenal, especially during the Clan Invasion, serving as a long-range support Mech.</p>",
            "16": "<p>The Mauler's deployment varied significantly, with different configurations adapting to diverse combat roles and scenarios. These configurations ranged from sniper-focused setups to heavy assault modifications. The Mauler\u2019s widespread use extended beyond the Draconis Combine, with various forces within the Inner Sphere, including the AFFS and LAAF, utilizing it in numerous military engagements.</p>",
            "17": "<p>Throughout its operational history, the Mauler has been integral to many military campaigns and conflicts. Its adaptability to changing battlefield conditions in the Inner Sphere has cemented its role as a versatile and formidable assault Mech.</p>"

        "overview": "The Mauler's arsenal is primarily focused on long-range engagements, featuring a combination of light autocannons and missile systems, supplemented by energy weapons. This loadout allows the Mauler to excel in support roles, offering sustained fire from a distance. Despite its impressive offensive capabilities, the Mech's limited heat dissipation can pose challenges during intense combat, necessitating careful heat management by its pilots. Its eleven and a half tons of ferro-fibrous armor provide substantial protection, but its top speed of 54 km/h limits its mobility on the battlefield.",
        "capabilities": "At its core, the Mauler is equipped with a formidable array of weaponry, primarily geared towards long-range engagements. This includes extended-range lasers and LRM launchers, allowing it to deliver powerful strikes from a distance. The integration of these advanced weapon systems, coupled with an extra-light engine, significantly enhances its offensive capabilities, making it a formidable opponent in ranged combat scenarios.Defensively, the Mauler is protected by a robust arrangement of ferro-fibrous armor, providing substantial resilience against enemy fire. Its defensive prowess is further augmented by the sophisticated CASE system, designed to protect the pilot from critical damage. The Mauler's speed, capped at 54 km/h, is optimized for maintaining optimal distance in combat, enabling it to leverage its long-range weaponry effectively while minimizing exposure to enemy attacks.The unique technological aspects of the Mauler include its advanced heat sink system, crucial for managing the heat generated by its high-powered armaments. This system allows the Mauler to sustain prolonged engagements, delivering consistent firepower without the risk of overheating. Additionally, the Mauler's design prioritizes ammunition efficiency, ensuring a steady supply for its ballistic and missile-based weaponry, crucial for maintaining its combat effectiveness in extended battles.",
        "deployment": "The MAL-2D Mauler, a formidable 90-ton juggernaut from the Inner Sphere, stands out with its distinct armament and capabilities. Powered by a 270 Fusion Engine and supported by standard Inner Sphere structure, the MAL-2D is built to endure the rigors of heavy combat.",
        "history": "The Mauler, initially developed as the Daboku by Luthien Armor Works (LAW), originated from a Draconis Combine initiative in 3036. This project aimed to capitalize on advanced Star League technology from the Helm Memory Core and ComStar's contributions. The design was intended to mirror the Star League's Thug using the Charger chassis for streamlined production.",
